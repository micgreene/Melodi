      + Stretch Goal: Playlist info can be shared among users via a "share" button.
    + **What stretch goals are you going to aim for?**
      + IM alerts
      + Playlist Sharing

  ## Functional Requirements
  
    + **List the functionality of your product. This will consist of tasks such as the following:**
      + Only the user can update their profile information
      + A user can search for other user profiles, musical acts' profiles, and musician types.
      + A user may instant message other users.
      + A user may listen to embedded playlists.
  ## Data Flow
  
    + Login: User is prompted to login, a db server is contacted to do basic auth.
    + Edit: Users may update their profile with text information, Spotify playlists, and photos. A db server is contacted to update the profile schema attached to this user. Uploading of files is handled via a WebRTC connection.
    + Message: Users may IM other users, a new room is created via Socket.io to facilitate chat.
    + Play Music: Users may embed playlists, a call is made to the Spotify API to retrieve song/album cover data.
    + Search: Users may search for other users based on various criteria. A db server is contacted to retrieve a list of current users based on the search criteria.
    + Logout: User is able to view/search other profiles and play music while logged out.
  
  ## Non-Functional Requirements
  
    + **Non-functional requirements are requirements that are not directly related to the functionality of the application but still important to the app.**
      + Security — Product will store username/password info in an auth db. Usernames must be kept unique. Based authentication token is issued to allow editing of a profile page.
      + Maintainability  + Manageability— Using React and identical user profile layouts means components are easily fixed/expanded upon. As there is only one web server currently deployed, an administrator can easily single out and patch the profile schema as required. As scalability issues occur, so too will our ability to manage so much data. 
      + Scalability – Under the current model, only a single web server is being deployed. As the number of users increases it could strain SQL. This would be addressed by automatic deployment of additional web servers.
